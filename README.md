# Club Penguin Automation

A repo for the scripts I've created for automating the games within Club Penguin.
Currently only contains one script.

## How to Use (All Scripts)

## Bean Counter

Bean Counters is the game available at the coffee shop when clicking on the Java bag.
This script will play the main game for you on loop.

## Cart Surfer

Cart Surfer is the game available in the mine by clicking on the minecarts.
This script will play the game for you on a loop in a way that intends to maximize points.
It is recommended to have previously collected all stamps for Cart Surfer, as that will double the coins you get.
